          Introduction

        <p class="mb-6">
          I've always enjoyed staring at the ocean. But what if I had the ocean
          at home on my computer? This is the question I bravely asked as I set
          out to implement an OpenGL program to mimic the ocean.

          Why OpenGL?
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
          <strong>OpenGL</strong> - Low level cross-platform graphics
          programming API.<br />
          <strong>Shader</strong> - Program that runs on the GPU.

        <p class="mb-6">
          Why suffer through the pain of using OpenGL instead of using a
          higher-level graphics framework or library? As an engineer, wanting to
          know how things work is inherent to who I am. Programming at a low-ish
          level like this provides several benefits: it forces me to think
          harder about making my own abstractions, and it teaches me about
          (in)efficiencies with different implementations. Both these skills
          come in handy when debugging code made with higher level tools.

            pieces.

          Initial Planning
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          To begin, I should mention I'll be doing the rendering through
          rasterization (as opposed to ray tracing/marching). This means I'll be
          describing a scene in 3D space, then doing some algebra to project
          this 3D world onto a 2D plane which determines the pixel colours.
        </p>
        <p>
          To render this scene, I'll generate a plane of vertices, then displace
          these vertices with a wave function. Later, I'll put this plane in a
          skybox when it's time to make the waves look a bit more realistic with
          reflections. The final executable will utilize 2 shader programs: one
          to render the waves, and one to render the background.
        </p>
        <h3 id="rendering-a-plane" class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">
          Rendering a Plane
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          I first start by generating points for and rendering a simple plane. I
          generate evenly spaced points and record their index ordering for
          passing to the EBO for rendering.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          In the vertex shader, I displace the vertical position with a sine
          function <span class="math display">\[p = (x,sin(x,z), z)\]</span> In
          the fragment shader, I assign a blue colour to each pixel in the mesh.
          Finally, I displace the camera slightly so I can view the plane.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          I have a wave! I can see I have motion and depth, but it would be nice
          if I had a bit of lighting off the surface of the mesh, so that I can
          better tell what's going on.
        </p>
        <h3 id="lighting" class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Lighting</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          For this shader program, I chose to implement
          <a
            class="text-blue-700"

          >
          lighting. This is a fundamental lighting model in computer graphics,
          and itâ€™s extensible for adding later lighting features. There are 3
          aspects to Blinn Phong lighting: ambient, specular, and diffuse light.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          To begin implementing this lighting method, the surface normal for
          each vertex is required. Thankfully, as I have a simple function for
          the displacement of each vertex, I get for free a simple derivative
          that will give me the <strong>exact</strong> normal for each vertex
          <span class="math display">\[dy/dx = cos(x)\]</span> Using the normal
          as calculated in the vertex shader I calculate the lighting
          contribution for each pixel.

          patterns.

          Improving the Wave Displacement Algorithm
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          With the basics out of the way, it's time to look at more realistic
          wave algorithms for displacing our plane vertices.

          describes how I can achieve more complex looking waves using a sum of
          sines calculation.
          <span class="math display"

            \frac{dy}{dx}=\sum_{i = 0}^{N}{f'(x)} \]</span
          >
          Thankfully, the derivative of the sum equals the sum of the
          derivative, which means I can more or less wrap the displacement and
          normal calculations in a loop. After adding some pseudo randomly
          generated wave parameters, and summing just 4 waves, I arrive at this
          animation.

          Then, I change the wave function to one with steeper peaks and lower
          troughs by updating the displacement and normal computations in the
          vertex shader.

          Adding a Skybox for Reflections
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          In this stage, I add more realism to the surface by adding an
          atmosphere to view in the distance. To be somewhat realistic, this
          atmosphere must also be reflected off the surface of the water.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          A skybox is pretty much exactly what the name suggests: a box
          surrounding our scene with images of the sky. I implement the skybox
          as a separate shader. I define a box surrounding the wave plane,
          mapping a pretty sky picture to it. In the fragment shader of the wave
          shader program, I check the camera angle, then sample the skybox
          texture to determine what colour to reflect off the surface pixel.

        <p class="mb-6">
          Not too bad! We see whites from the clouds reflected, as well as the
          blue of the sky. The wave function could still be more
          interesting/realistic, and the lighting params improved for more
          natural-looking light.

        <p class="mb-6">
          Over the course of a couple sections, I've shown how to implement a
          complex looking animation through little more than some basic calculus
          and linear algebra. I'll likely post a follow-up blog where I
          implement a more realistic wave function, but this seems like a good
          place to stop before going down the realism rabbit hole.
